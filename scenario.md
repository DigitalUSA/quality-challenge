# Scenario

*Questionalable Quality Software (QQs)* have got themselves into a pickle!!!

QQs builds custom Geographic information system [Wikipedia: GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system). They have recently begun experimenting with Microservices and engaged a consulting company to create their first Microservice. QQs defined the scope of the service as follows:

- A service to determine if a 2d point is within a circle or not.
- A service to detemrine if a 2d point is within a regular polygon.
- A service to determine if a 2d point is within a polygon.

The consulting company delivered the software on Apr 1st with [this](deliver-report.md) report and a demo to the team. For various reasons the software was not tested further until recently and the consulting company no longer exists.

QQs has numerous concerns about the software they received as numerous unexplained errors are occuring in initial testing and this is blocking further work with Microservices. The leadership at QQs are also losing confidence in the teams ability to delivery.

As a last ditch effort QQs are again reaching out to you as a consultant to help them.

Your mission is to review the delivered artifacts from the original consulting firm and produce a report. That report should contain a list of issues found, recommendations for process & tooling and any fixes and improvements that can be made immediately.
