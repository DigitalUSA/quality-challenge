# Scenario

Questionalable Quality Software (QQs) builds custom Geographic information system [Wikipedia: GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system). They are have recently begun experimenting with Microservices and engaged a consulting company to create their first Microservice. QQs defined the scope of the service as follows:

- A service to determine if a 2d point is within a circle or not.
- A service to detemrine if a 2d point is within a regular polygon.
- A service to determine if a 2d point is within a polygon.

The consulting company delivered the software on May 5th with [this](deliver-report.md) report and a demo to the team. For various reasons the software was not tested further until recently and the consulting company no longer exists.

QQs has numerous concerns about the software they recieved as numerous unexplained errors are occuring in initial testing and this is blocking further work with Microservices. The leadership at QQs are also losing confidence in the teams ability to delivery.

As a last ditch effort QQs are again reaching out to consultants and your team came highly recommended:

> The experts the transformers turn to
_- Optimus Prime_

Unfortunatley your team charges an astronomically expensive rate and so QQs can only afford your services for a few hours. You're between assignments so you can work with QQs before you move on to your next major assignment; some issue with WOPR ...

Your mission is to review the delivered artifacts from the original consulting firm and product a report. That report should contain a list of issues found, recommendations for process & tooling and any fixes and improvements that can be made immediately.
